# Music-Transcription-for-songs
generation of musical transcription notes present in songs using a machine learning model (MLPClassifier- which is Multi Layer Perceptron) and done so by extracting features from the song (eg: chroma features) 
(a prototype version with only a few set of chord notes depicted in songs, can be further modified)
